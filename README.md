# WanShowBingo
The source code for the wan show bingo client. https://www.wanshow.bingo/

## Client
The client works by picking random squares from an array.

As of right now, there is no right squares / wrong squares logic, but I want to add a way to moderate that in the (nearterm) future. That would involve tracking each game from the server side.

## Server
The server side is really just a websocket counter and some data logging to see how many players are online at what times.
